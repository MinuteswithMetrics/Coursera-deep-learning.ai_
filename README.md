# Deep Learning specialization by Deeplearning.ai|Cousera

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

AI is transforming multiple industries. This specialization is a great help to break into AI. Five courses that will help to learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks and how to lead successful machine learning projects. Convolutional 
networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more are some of the subjects covered. 
Working on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language 
processing. The idea is not only mastering the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. Practicing all these ideas 
in Python and in TensorFlow.
