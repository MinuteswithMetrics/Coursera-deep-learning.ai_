# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning

Breaking into cutting-edge AI, this course will help to do so. Deep learning is a new "superpower" that will let you build AI systems that just weren't possible a few years ago.

The foundations of deep learning are covered in this course:

- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning.
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks.
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks.
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture.

This course also teaches how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. The idea is to be able to apply deep learning to my own applications

This is the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization.
